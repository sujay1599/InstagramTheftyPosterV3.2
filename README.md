- Download and save reels along with their captions.
- Upload reels to your Instagram account with customizable descriptions.
- Optionally add reels to your Instagram story.
- Periodically delete uploaded reels based on user-defined intervals.
- Use hashtags and give credit in the reel descriptions.
- Interval-based scraping and uploading.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InstagramTheftyPoster.git
   cd InstagramTheftyPoster
   ```

2. Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Run `start.py` to create the `config.yaml` file:
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```
   Follow the prompts to enter your configuration details. This will generate a `config.yaml` file with the necessary settings, including encrypted Instagram credentials.

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
